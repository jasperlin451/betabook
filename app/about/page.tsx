      <SectionHeading className="mt-4">What is Betabook</SectionHeading>
      <p className="leading-relaxed text-pretty">
        Betabook is a climbing logbook and crag database — somewhere to keep the routes you&apos;ve
        climbed and the places you climbed them.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading className="mt-4">Not a Guidebook or Social Media</SectionHeading>
      <p className="leading-relaxed text-pretty">
        Betabook does not aim to become a guidebook site or a social media platform. While there is
        detailed info on the platform to help find and share crags, the aim of this site is not to
        become a guidebook replacement, but to simply be a gathering place where users can share
        what they’re climbing.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading className="mt-4">For the Community</SectionHeading>
      <p className="leading-relaxed text-pretty">
        The success of Betabook depends on its community. It will only hold value as users join,
        keep information on this site accurate, and log sends to help drive consensus on climbs.
        Because this project relies on the community, its core philosophy is community-driven as
        well.

         * hand (AppLink does that for itself). `inline` matters: .link is
         * display:inline-flex, an atomic inline box that can't break across
         * lines mid-sentence. `underline` because a link inside a sentence has

        I also built this to be as cheap as possible so as to avoid charging any user fees or
        displaying ads. This is why Betabook doesn’t support any image or video uploads as those can
        get expensive quickly. You can read a writeup of the{" "}

        . Ideally, we can keep costs under $10/month at which point I can either foot the bill
        myself or open a donation drive to cover server costs. If activity grows to a point where
        this isn’t sustainable then I’m sure we can work out a new funding model then.

      <p className="leading-relaxed text-pretty">
        Currently, to build this site I’ve programmatically seeded the database with climbs and
        their known physical locations. However I haven’t added any detailed descriptions as that is
        intellectual property and should be written in one’s own words. If you come across a climb
        or area missing a description please contribute.

        Thanks for choosing Betabook as your logging platform of choice and happy sending.
