-- Hand-written (see 0001_fts5_search.sql): drizzle-kit doesn't model triggers.
-- Kept in numeric sequence with the generated migrations so
-- `wrangler d1 migrations apply` runs it in order.
--
-- areas_fts/climbs_fts are external-content FTS5 tables, and until now every
-- write path had to remember to mirror its base-table statement into the FTS
-- index by hand. That drifted in practice: renames never touched the index at
-- all, deleteClimb never removed its row, and create/delete paths issued the
-- base write and the index write as two separate D1 statements — so a failure
-- between them left the index out of sync while the base row was already
-- committed. These triggers are the canonical FTS5 external-content pattern:
-- the index update runs inside the very same statement as the base-table
-- write, so it's atomic by construction and no future mutation can forget it.
--
-- The UPDATE triggers fire on `UPDATE OF name` only, so bulk lft/rght
-- rewrites (recomputeAreaTree) and send-counter updates don't churn the index.
--
-- NOTE for future table rebuilds (the 0011 pattern: CREATE __new_x / DROP x /
-- RENAME): DROP TABLE drops these triggers with it — recreate them, and
-- rebuild the index afterwards, just like the hand-written indexes there.
