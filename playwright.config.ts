  //             review still gets one light and one dark screenshot.
  //   @behavior independent of viewport and theme both. Runs once, desktop-light.
  // Needing fewer runs is not a reason to tag: the assertions must be unable to
  // vary. Anything that reads a color, or that renders differently per theme,
  // stays untagged.
