# Claude Code WorktreeCreate hook: create the worktree with a real
# `git worktree add` so .husky/post-checkout bootstraps it.
#
# Claude's built-in creation does not run .husky/post-checkout, so agent-made
# worktrees arrive without node_modules or a seeded D1. Why is unverified — the
# new worktree's reflog is identical to the one a plain `git worktree add`
# leaves, so it does not say. Defining this hook replaces that built-in path,
# and the `git worktree add` below does fire post-checkout.
#
# Contract, as the runtime actually implements it: the last line of stdout must
# be the directory the hook created, and any non-zero exit aborts creation. The
# published docs describe a JSON result and source_path/worktree_path/is_git
# fields on stdin — this build sends none of them and parses no JSON, so both
# ends are read defensively.
