 * CSS exposes no other signal that it truncated anything, so this has to be
 * measured against real layout.
 *
 * Two things change the answer after the first measurement and neither is a
 * re-render: the element's width (the text rewraps into a different number of
 * lines) and the webfont swapping in under `display: swap` (the clamped height
 * is a multiple of the unchanged font-size, so the ResizeObserver never fires,
 * but the content height moves). Hence the observer *and* the fonts.ready
