 * controlled — forced open from `breakpoint` up (where the trigger row is
 * CSS-hidden, so it can't be re-collapsed) and user-toggled below. Crossing
 * the breakpoint therefore only flips the expanded state; the children keep
 * their state instead of a second pristine copy becoming visible.
 *
 * SSR can't know the viewport, so the server renders the panel *expanded* —
 * the one render that works on desktop without JS, and the only one that
 * avoids fighting the `hidden` attribute a collapsed panel carries (the
 * preflight `[hidden]` rule is `!important` in an early cascade layer, which
 * beats `!` utilities). Below the breakpoint a pre-hydration-only CSS class
 * keeps the panel visually collapsed until `useIsDesktop` resolves, in the
 * same pre-paint commit that hands control to `isExpanded`. Tradeoff: below
 * the breakpoint without JS the panel can't be expanded, and until hydration
 * the trigger's indicator/aria-expanded read as expanded while the panel is
 * CSS-hidden. */
